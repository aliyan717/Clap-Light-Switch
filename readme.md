# 👏 Clap-Activated Light Control System 💡

This project demonstrates a basic **sound-based automation system** using an Arduino Uno and a relay module to control an AC bulb via clap detection. The system uses a sound sensor module to register audio spikes (like a clap) and toggles the relay accordingly. It serves as a simple prototype for noise-activated smart control applications in home automation.

## 📘 Objective

The objective of this project is to design a low-cost, embedded system that can detect a clap sound and use it to control high-voltage electrical loads, demonstrating the principles of sensor-based switching, signal processing, and relay interfacing in embedded systems.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The sound sensor continuously monitors environmental noise.
2. When a **clap** is detected (sharp sound spike), it sends a **digital HIGH signal** to Arduino.
3. The Arduino toggles the **relay state**, switching the connected AC bulb **ON or OFF**.
4. The system can also be tested safely using an LED instead of an AC load.

## ⚠️ Safety Notice

This project includes an AC load. When working with relays and 220V:
- Ensure proper insulation and terminal protection
- Avoid handling live wires directly
- Use safety gloves and isolate circuits before uploading new code
